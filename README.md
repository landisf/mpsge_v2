# mpsge_v2
Implementation of Tom Rutherford's MPS/GE in Ruby. The goal is to first replicate and then extend MPSGE's functionality.

GAMS includes some utilities that work only under MS Windows. At the development stage, this program is only tested on a Windows platform and build streams are written with .bat files.
